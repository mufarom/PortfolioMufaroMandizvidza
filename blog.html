            <h3>How I Found The Assignment</h3>
            <p>The assignment was a rather fair one. I found it challenging for the most part, but figuring it all out
               was exciting and thrilling for me. I did run into a couple of bumps on the way, but I am overally pleased
               with what I have produced knowing where I started from. The content that was taught in the lectures is
               exactly how the assignment was supposed to be developed.</p>

            <h3>Using Grids In HTML</h3>
            <p>When I began the portfolio development journey for this module, I had some prior knwoledge as to how the
               grids work and how to form them due to the lectures and slide notes. However, I had not realised that I
               only knew how to form the basic grid layout and this frustrated me as I went about my online research,
               finding way easier methods such as using the infamous "div" tag. I then found out that using grids
               creates more structure and organisation to the website, and I can now safely say I am more than
               comforatble with the use of grids.</p>

            <h3>Some Of The Things I Learnt During Development</h3>
            <p>During my journey of developing my web portfolio, I came across many different html and css tools that I
               made use of to try and enhance the look and use of my website. I made use of features such as the blank
               space, grid targeting, icons and transforming objects to my liking among many others. Some of the aspects
               took longer and more effort that I initially expected, such as in the site report, where I decided to
               target the grids using the validation screenshots. Overall, it was a wonderful learning experience for
               me.</p>
